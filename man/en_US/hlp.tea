{{HLP Command}}

	The {HLP} command print command help. It is a batch script acting as
	a front-end of the {tea|TEA} command.

{{Synopsis}}

${HLP [name | /b language [encoding] | /l | /d]}

	Print a manual page.

	- {name} : The name of the manual page to be printed.

	- {/b} : Build documentation for a given language and a given encoding.
	This switch is used to produce files from {tea|TEA} documents shipped
	with {pBat}. The parameters that can be specified are:

		-- {language} : The language in which the documentation will be
		generated. A list of languages available can be obtained through
		the {/l} switch.

		-- {encoding} : The encoding that will be used by generated manual
		pages. This parameters requires {iconv|GNU iconv} to be installled.
		The default encoding is {utf-8}. This parameter is useful if your
		terminal does not support {utf-8} encoding.

	- {/l} : Print a list of all languages available on the current machine.
	Available languages are shown through {POSIX} locales, that is in form of
	{language_COUNTRY} where {language} and {country} are both abbreviations.

	- {/c} : Configures {hlp.bat} command parameter. Prompt the user for the
	selected language, format (html, text or ansi) and encoding to be used.
	This option is an user-friendly way to configure the configuration file
	{%USERPROFILE%/.pbat/hlp/hlp.conf.bat}.

{{Config file}}

${%USERPROFILE%/share/hlp/hlp.conf.bat}

	A batch script defining hlp setting through a set of variables. This file
	can be generated using the {/c} switch. This file is run on {hlp.bat} startup.
	Variables that must be set are the following:

		- {%mode%} : The file format to be used by {hlp.bat}. It must be one of the
		following three formats:

			-- {html} : Help pages will be displayed through an html medium and a web
			browser. This requires a web browser and a working {start} command.

			-- {ansi} : Help pages will be displayed at the command prompt, using
			ANSI escape codes for formatting. This obviously requires an ANSI-compatible
			terminal.
			-- {txt} : Help pages will be displayed at the command prompt using plain text

		- {%locale%} : The language of help pages using a {POSIX} local (e.g {language_COUNTRY}).
		The corresponding locale has to be installed in {%PBAT_PATH%/share/hlp/man}.

		- {%view_cmd%} : The command to be used for Help pages display. This can either be an
		internal or an external command. By default, {hlp} uses :

		${set view_cmd=!%mode%_prg!}

		@- Where variables {%txt_prg%}, {%html_prg%} et {%ansi_prg%} define the commands to be
		executed for every format.

{{Compatibility}}
