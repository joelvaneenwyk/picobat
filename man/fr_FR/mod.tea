{{MOD Command}}

	The {MOD} command is {pbat|pBat}-specific command that enable
	external modules designed for {pBat} to be loaded at runtime in order
	to provide extra functionalities through additional internal
	commands.

{{Synopsis}}

${MOD [/l] [/q] [module ...]}

	Load or list loaded modules.

	- {/l} : List loaded modules.

	- {/q} : Ignore {module} silently if it has already been loaded.

	- {module} : A path to the module to be loaded. If {module} is
	a relative path, then the associated file is searched inside the
    module default path (which is {%PBAT_PATH%/modules}). If {module}
    is an absolute path, the preceding behaviour is overridden and {MOD} tries
    to load the file referred to by {module}.

	Modules files are executables that can be dynamically loaded
	by {pBat} and that have been programmed to add commands to
	the interpreter.

	The process of writing a module for pBat and their
	capabilities are described inside the {GUIDELINES} file of the
	source distribution.

{{Compatibility}}

	Not compatible with {cmd.exe}, this is an extension. Available
	since version {218.3}.
